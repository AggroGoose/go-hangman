# GoLang Hangman

This project is to warm myself back up to GoLang playing with file structure, structs and loops to create a CLI game. The ASCII art is borrowed, but the code is wholly my own. The plan is to build a simple CLI game with state management allowing you to guess letters to the word and escape the game if necessary.

# Key Takeaways

While the game could be completed in fewer lines of code, I wanted to play around with using struct methods across files as a refresher to get warmed up for using GO again. In the app I played with reading from a CSV file (in place of a db), managing app state and accepting multiple command inputs, and building in an overarching 'brain' functionality for the game. While simple, it was a good refresher to work on more complex GO projects.
